        2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

        In Short: We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.

        We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:
        To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user. We may process your information to provide you with the requested service.

        To save or protect an individual's vital interest. We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.

        3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

        In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.

        If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.

        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
        Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.
        Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
        Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
        Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.

        If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.

        We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click here to learn more.

        In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
        If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
        For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
        For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
        If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
        For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
        If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
        If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
        If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
        If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
        If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
        If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

        4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

        In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.

        We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:
        Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

        5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

        In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.

        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

        6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

        In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.

        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

        7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

        In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.

        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at management@signworks.ma.

        8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

        In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.

        In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.

        We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
        
        If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.

        If you are located in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.

        Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.

        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

        Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

        If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at info@signworks.ma.

        9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

        10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?

        In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.

        California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the 'Shine The Light' law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.

        If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).

        CCPA Privacy Notice

        The California Code of Regulations defines a 'resident' as:

        (1) every individual who is in the State of California for other than a temporary or transitory purpose and
        (2) every individual who is domiciled in the State of California who is outside the State of California for a temporary or transitory purpose

        All other individuals are defined as 'non-residents'.

        If this definition of 'resident' applies to you, we must adhere to certain rights and obligations regarding your personal information.

        What categories of personal information do we collect?

        We have collected the following categories of personal information in the past twelve (12) months:



        We may also collect other personal information outside of these categories through instances where you interact with us in person, online, or by phone or mail in the context of:
        Receiving help through our customer support channels;
        Participation in customer surveys or contests; and
        Facilitation in the delivery of our Services and to respond to your inquiries.
        How do we use and share your personal information?

        More information about our data collection and sharing practices can be found in this privacy notice.

        You may contact us by email at info@signworks.ma, by visiting http://www.signworks.ma/contact, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.

        If you are using an authorised agent to exercise your right to opt out we may deny a request if the authorised agent does not submit proof that they have been validly authorised to act on your behalf.

        Will your information be shared with anyone else?

        We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written contract between us and each service provider. Each service provider is a for-profit entity that processes the information on our behalf.

        We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be 'selling' of your personal information.

        Signworks S.A.R.L has not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months. Signworks S.A.R.L will not sell personal information in the future belonging to website visitors, users, and other consumers.

        Your rights with respect to your personal data

        Right to request deletion of the data — Request to delete

        You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.

        Right to be informed — Request to know

        Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:
        whether we collect and use your personal information;
        the categories of personal information that we collect;
        the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;
        whether we sell your personal information to third parties;
        the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose;
        the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and
        the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.
        In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.

        Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights

        We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.

        Verification process

        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

        Other privacy rights
        You may object to the processing of your personal information.
        You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.

        Financial Incentives

        'Financial incentive' means a program, benefit, or other offering, including payments to consumers as compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, or sale of personal information.

        The law permits financial incentives or a price or service difference if it is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. A business must be able to explain how the financial incentive or price or service difference is reasonably related to the value of the consumer’s data. The explanation must include:
        a good-faith estimate of the value of the consumer’s data that forms the basis for offering the financial incentive or price or service difference; and
        a description of the method the business used to calculate the value of the consumer’s data.
        We may decide to offer a financial incentive (e.g. price or service difference) in exchange for the retention or sale of a consumer’s personal information.

        If we decide to offer a financial incentive, we will notify you of such financial incentive and explain the price difference, as well as material terms of the financial incentive or price of service difference, including the categories of personal information that are implicated by the financial incentive or price or service difference.

        If you choose to participate in the financial incentive you can withdraw from the financial incentive at any time by emailing us at info@signworks.ma, by visiting http://www.signworks.ma/contact, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.
